## Background & Objectives

A challenge to help you get to know basic Bootstrap classes:

- Text and list classes: `.text-center`, `.list-inline`...
- Button classes: `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-success` `.btn-lg`...
- Form classes: `.form-inline`, `form-control`...

## Specs

In this challenge, reproduce [this page](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/08-Final-airbnb-home-without-grid/) by using **as many Bootstrap classes as possible.**

- Every time you need to design a component, look first in the [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) to see if a class already exists for it.
- For the banner and the footer you will have to write your own CSS. For the banner component, grab it from the [Le Wagon library](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components/#banner) and put the CSS code in `banner.css`.

## Further suggestions & resources

### Icons & pictures

For the banner's background image we give you a `background.jpg` image in the images folder. Feel free to pick another one on [thestocks](http://thestocks.im/) or to use a placeholder from [unsplash.it](http://unsplash.it). Don't forget: **hi-res**!

For the icons, we also give your 4 icons (`globe.png`, `dollar.png`, `heart.png`, `beer.png`) from [Nucleo Free Pack](https://nucleoapp.com/). Feel free to pick your own icons from the resources we gave you ([NounProject](http://thenounproject.com/), [Kameleon](http://www.kameleon.pics/) or [Streamline](http://www.streamlineicons.com/)). Don't spend too much time on it - there are lots of other interesting challenges today too!
